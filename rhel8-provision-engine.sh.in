# The following is needed in order to create an initial package
# tr-ocp-installer. This is a dummy package that will have 
# the real openshift-install bin just after upgrade.
# The openshift-install bin is built with the related patch in
# terraform-provider-ovirt repo and its purpose is to check if changes
# suggested by the patch are fully compatible with OCP.
# In its initial form the package contains a shell script
# named openshift-install that prints an error and exits.
